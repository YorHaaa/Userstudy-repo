## Purpose

This version of the Guice repository is used as part of a research study evaluating how developers interact with code comments—both with and without the aid of a VS Code extension designed to classify and visualize inline documentation.

 

Participants will be asked to complete tasks and answer questions based on the contents of this repository. The modifications made are minimal and primarily focused on enabling comment classification and visualization support.
